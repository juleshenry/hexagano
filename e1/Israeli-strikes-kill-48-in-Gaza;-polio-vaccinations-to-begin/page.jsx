        <h2>Israeli strikes kill 48 in Gaza; polio vaccinations to begin (Major humanitarian crisis and vaccination effort)</h2>
            <div className={styles.article}>

The situation in Gaza has taken a devastating turn as Israeli airstrikes have left at least 48 Palestinians dead and hundreds more injured, sparking widespread outrage and humanitarian concerns. The strikes, which began on Sunday evening, targeted multiple locations in the blockaded territory, including refugee camps and residential areas.

This latest escalation comes amidst an already dire humanitarian crisis, with Gaza's healthcare system on the brink of collapse due to years of blockade and conflict. The United Nations has warned that a polio outbreak is imminent without immediate vaccination efforts, prompting international aid agencies to rush in with emergency supplies.

The Israeli military claims it targeted Hamas sites and infrastructure, but eyewitnesses describe scenes of utter devastation, with entire neighborhoods reduced to rubble. Palestinian officials have accused Israel of committing "massacres" and called for an end to the "indiscriminate bombing."

Gaza's 2 million residents are already struggling with limited access to clean water, electricity, and medical care. The polio vaccination campaign is a critical step in preventing a potential outbreak, which could spread quickly across the region.

The international community has condemned the violence, with the United States calling for an immediate ceasefire and UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres urging restraint. As the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate, it's crucial that all parties work together to prevent further suffering and find a lasting solution to this decades-long conflict.
