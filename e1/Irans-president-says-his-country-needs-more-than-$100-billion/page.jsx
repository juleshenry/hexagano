        <h2>IranÂ´s president says his country needs more than $100 billion in foreign investment (High-level government announcement)</h2>
            <div className={styles.article}>
In a high-stakes move, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has announced his country's need for over $100 billion in foreign investment to revive its struggling economy. The statement, made during a meeting with top economic officials, signals a significant shift in Iran's approach to attracting international capital.

For decades, Iran has faced crippling sanctions imposed by the United States and other Western nations, crippling its ability to access global financial markets. However, with the 2015 nuclear deal (JCPOA) and subsequent lifting of some sanctions, Tehran is now seeking to capitalize on renewed diplomatic overtures and diversify its economic relationships.

Iran's economy has long been plagued by corruption, mismanagement, and a lack of transparency. The country's GDP growth rate has stagnated in recent years, with inflation remaining a major concern. To turn the tide, Raisi's administration is counting on foreign investment to inject much-needed capital into key sectors such as energy, infrastructure, and manufacturing.

The massive injection of funds will be crucial in modernizing Iran's antiquated industries and creating jobs for its growing youth population. However, concerns remain over potential risks associated with foreign involvement, including the possibility of economic dependence and national security implications.

Raisi's appeal for international investment comes as global powers, such as China and Europe, seek to strengthen ties with Tehran. The move may also be seen as a response to neighboring countries like Turkey, which have made significant strides in attracting foreign capital in recent years.

As the world watches Iran's economic fortunes closely, the stakes are high for both Tehran and international investors. Will Raisi's administration succeed in luring in the billions needed to revive its economy? Only time will tell.
