        <h2>Serbia unlikely to join EU before end of decade, says President Vucic (Important update on European Union membership prospects)</h2>
            <div className={styles.article}>
In a surprise move, Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić has cast doubt on his country's likelihood of joining the European Union before the end of the decade. Speaking at a press conference in Belgrade, Vučić emphasized that Serbia's integration into the EU will take longer than initially expected.

This development comes as a blow to those hoping for swift progress towards Serbia's accession talks. The country has been negotiating with the EU since 2009, but ongoing tensions with Kosovo – which declared independence from Serbia in 2008 – have long been a major stumbling block.

Serbia's bid for EU membership was put on hold in 2014 when Brussels suspended talks due to Belgrade's failure to normalize relations with Kosovo. While some progress has been made since then, the two countries remain at odds over issues like border demarcation and minority rights.

President Vučić's warning echoes previous statements from other high-ranking officials, who have expressed concerns about the EU's willingness to engage in meaningful dialogue on Serbia's membership bid. The country's leaders are keenly aware that any concessions made on Kosovo would be met with resistance from hardline nationalist groups within Serbia.

As the global landscape continues to shift, it appears that Serbia's EU aspirations will need to take a backseat for now. With the ongoing crisis in Ukraine and the rise of populist forces across Europe, the EU's ability to absorb new members may be limited in the short term. As President Vučić warned, "The road ahead will be long and arduous."
